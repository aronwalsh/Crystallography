First open the `cif` in any text editor (Notepad is fine on windows, but for advanced users [atom](https://atom.io) is nice). Check that your understand the key information that the file contains. Then open up the structure Crystalmaker (`File` -> `Open`) to check the bond lengths and angles. \n",

For example, rocksalt can be obtained by filling octahedral holes, while zincblende can be obtained by filling tetrahedral holes in an fcc structure.\n",

For each structure type, a critical radius can be determined from a straightforward geometric analysis, which represents the limit where the radii of the anions touch. This is called the critical radius ratio.\n",
