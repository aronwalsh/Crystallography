    "### Advanced questions (from students)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q1. What do A, B, and C represent for base-centered Bravais lattices?\n",
    "\n",
    "The base-centered lattice refers to a unit cell that contains lattice points on the cell corners with one additional point at the center of each face of one pair of parallel faces of the cell. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is not possible in a cubic system as each lattice vector is equivalent, and therefore we cannot isolate one pair of faces. However, taking an orthorhombic system where a, b and c directions are unique, there are three possible pairs of faces, giving rise to the possibility of A, B or C base-centering.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q2. Why are only certain combinations of crystal system and centering allowed?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bravais showed that the combination of 7 crystal systems with all types of centring results in the 14 unique Bravais lattices in 3D. Other combinations would result in a lattice description that is equivalent to one of the 14 by a redefinition of the unit cell axes.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, P and I tetragonal cells are allowed. However, a base-centred tetragonal lattice (lattice points at the top and bottom faces) could be redefined as a P tetragonal cell with rotated lattice vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "A second example in 2D is that the centered-square lattice is not a Bravais lattice. It can again be redefined as a P square lattice with rotated lattice vectors (try to see this yourself with pen and paper).\n",
    "\n",
    "The mathematical proof for the 14 Bravais lattices is not typically covered in science/engineering courses, and is beyond the scope of this course. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q3. Centred Bravais lattices have a primitive unit cell?\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of the 14 Bravais lattices can be represented using a primitive unit cell with lattice points at each of the corners (see for example the article [\"Really, your lattices are all primitive, Mr. Bravais!\"](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ed070p959).  However, centred unit cells are convenient to crystallographers.\n",
    "\n",
    "A. Unit cells that contain a single lattice point are termed primitive. A primitive (P) lattice is fully described by a primitive unit cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "B. Centered unit cells contain two or more lattice points, which are referred to as a conventional (or full) unit cells, shown in green below. This description of a centred (e.g. I or F) lattice is favoured by crystallographers as it shows the underlying symmetry of the crystal structure and mathematical operations are simplified. However, a primitive unit cell with a smaller volume and non-90 degree angles can always be constructed, shown in turquoise. \n",

    "\n",
    "For more advanced reading, the International Union of Crystallography has a set of definitions: http://reference.iucr.org/dictionary/Centred_lattices\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q4. Are rhombohedral and hexagonal systems equivalent?\n",
    "\n",
    "I presented the 14 Bravais lattices in 3D, where hexagonal and rhombohedral are seperate members.\n",
    "\n",
    "A potential point of confusion is that lattices in the rhombohedral crystal family can also be described using hexagonal axes [e.g. see [here](http://www.globalsino.com/EM/image1/3546.gif)]. In crystallography, hexagonal and rhombohedral lattices are part of the same crystal family, but are two distinct crystal systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The real differences come down to symmetry elements. Rhombohedral crystals have a 3-fold rotational axis, while hexagonal crystals have a 6-fold rotational axis, so there is a clear distinction between the two crystal systems. We will cover symmetry in Lecture B."

Remember that the Miller index describes an infitite set of paralell planes. In practice, a plane passing through the origin can be defined in terms of a parallel plane having non-zero intercepts (thus avoiding the 1/0 term).\n",
